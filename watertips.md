SHOWER FACTS:
.Taking a 5-minute shower instead of a 10-minute shower saves 12.5 gallons with a low-flow shower head, and 25 gallons with a standard 5 gallon-per-minute shower head.. . mercurynews.com

.Put a bucket in the shower while you're waiting for the water to warm up, and use the water you catch for watering plants, flushing the toilet or cleaning.
Install a low-flow showerhead. It may cost you some money up front, but your water conservation efforts will save you money down the road. Conventional showerheads flow at 5 gallons per minute or more, whereas low-flow showerheads typically flow at 2.5 gallons per minute (or less!).
Turn off the water if you shave or brush your teeth in the shower to save time..-gracelinks.org

.If you use a low-flow showerhead, you can save 15 gallons of water during a 10-minute shower.
It takes about 70 gallons of water to fill a bathtub, so showers are generally the more water-efficient way to bathe..-nationgeographic.com

.In an average home, showers are typically the third largest water use after toilets and clothes washers. The average American shower uses 17.2 gallons (65.1 liters) and lasts for 8.2 minutes at average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute (gpm) (7.9 lpm).
The duration of the shower has a direct effect on water usage. A 20-minute shower will use twice as much water as a 10-minute shower taken at the same flow rate. .-nationalgeographic.com(long)


WATER SAVING FACTS:
.Conserving water is particularly important in dry climates or dry seasons and during droughts, to prevent depletion of the community.s water resources. Water conservation preserves habitat necessary for animal, plant and human survival, reduces pollutant runoff from fertilized lawns, prevents or delays the need to build additional reservoirs or treatment plants and decreases the use of energy to treat water.. .livestrong.com

.The average home in California uses 192 gallons of water a day, according to a 2008 study by the state Department of Water Resources and the Urban Water Conservation Council.

Turning the faucet off while brushing teeth or shaving saves about 10 gallons a day.
Using a broom to clean driveways, sidewalks and patios instead of a hose saves 8-18 gallons a minute.
Fixing the worn washers in a faucet with a slow steady drip saves 350 gallons per month, and 2,000 gallons a month if the leak is a small stream. Putting a new flapper in a leaking toilet can save 7,000 gallons a month. To test for leaks, put food coloring in the tank. Don't flush. Ten minutes later if you see color in the bowl, you have a leak.
Installing a water-efficient clothes washer saves up to 16 gallons a load. A water-efficient dishwasher saves up to 8 gallons a load. Rebates are available for water-saving appliances at most Bay Area water agencies.

Get a low-flow toilet. Flushing is the biggest water hog in the house. Older, conventional toilets can use 5 to 7 gallons per flush, but low-flow models use as little as 1.6 gallons. Since the average person flushes five times a day, the gallons can really add up.
If you can.t replace your higher volume toilet, put a plastic bottle filled with water in your toilet tank to reduce the amount of water used per flush..-gracelinks.org

Nearly 22% of indoor home water use comes from doing laundry. Save water by making sure to adjust the settings on your machine to the proper load size.
Dishwashing is a relatively small part of your water footprint.less than 2% of indoor use.but there are always ways to conserve. Using a machine is actually more water efficient than hand washing, especially if you run full loads.
Nearly 60% of a person's household water footprint can go toward lawn and garden maintenance.
Recycling a pound of paper, less than the weight of your average newspaper, saves about 3.5 gallons of water. Buying recycled paper products saves water too, as it takes about six gallons of water to produce a dollar worth of paper..-nationalgeographic.com
